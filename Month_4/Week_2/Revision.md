# Revision - Week 2

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Bit manipulation, Math (quick review)
- Backtracking basics from Month_2
- Advanced backtracking: Pruning, optimization
- Divide and conquer: Sorting algorithms

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Advanced backtracking [MUST] problems
2. **Day 2**: Divide and conquer problems (sorting)
3. **Day 3**: Review Month_2 backtracking basics
4. **Day 4**: Mixed practice (backtracking + recursion)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 problems, 60 min

## Focus Areas
- Backtracking: Pruning strategies, state management
- Recursion: Memoization, base cases
- Divide and conquer: Merge/quick sort implementation
- Optimization: Reduce time complexity with memoization

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Backtracking: Not unchoosing correctly
- Recursion: Missing base cases, stack overflow
- Divide and conquer: Incorrect merge logic
- Not using memoization when applicable
