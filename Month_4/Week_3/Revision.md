# Revision - Week 3

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Bit manipulation, Math (quick review)
- Week 2: Advanced backtracking, Divide and conquer
- Week 3: Design problems, OOD, Concurrency
- All core patterns from Months 1-4

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Design [MUST] problems (LRU Cache, Design Twitter)
2. **Day 2**: OOD problems (Parking Lot, Elevator)
3. **Day 3**: Review all [MUST] problems from Months 1-4
4. **Day 4**: Mock interview: 1 design + 1 DSA problem
5. **Day 5**: Weak area focus and pattern review

## Focus Areas
- OOD: SOLID principles, class design, relationships
- Design: Scalability, thread safety, extensibility
- Concurrency: Thread safety, synchronization
- Real-world: Practical implementation details

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- OOD: Not considering extensibility
- Design: Not handling edge cases
- Concurrency: Race conditions, deadlocks
- Not explaining design decisions clearly
