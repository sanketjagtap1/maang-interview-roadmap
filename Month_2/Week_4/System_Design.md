# System Design - Week 4

## Core Concepts
- Distributed consensus (Raft, Paxos basics)
- Distributed locking and leader election
- Monitoring and observability (metrics, logs, traces)
- Security and authentication (OAuth, JWT, API keys)

## Interview Focus Points
- **Consensus**: Leader election, fault tolerance
- **Distributed locks**: Redis, Zookeeper, etcd
- **Observability**: What to monitor, alerting strategies
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, rate limiting, encryption

## Practice
- Design a distributed lock service
- Design a monitoring/alerting system
- Design an authentication system

## Reading
- Raft consensus algorithm basics
- Distributed locking patterns
- Observability best practices (three pillars)
- Security best practices for APIs
