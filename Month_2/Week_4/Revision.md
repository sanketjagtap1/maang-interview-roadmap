# Revision - Week 4

## What to Revise
- **Full Month Review**: All topics from Weeks 1-4
- **Priority**: [MUST] problems from all weeks
- **Patterns**: Graphs, DP, Heaps, Trie, Greedy, Backtracking
- **Time Complexity**: Review O(V+E), O(n²), O(n log n) patterns

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Week 4 [MUST] problems (Greedy, Backtracking)
2. **Day 2**: Review all [MUST] problems from Weeks 1-3 (quick solve, 20 min each)
3. **Day 3**: Pattern-based practice (1 problem per major pattern)
4. **Day 4**: Mock interview simulation (3 problems, 60 min, random topics)
5. **Day 5**: Weak area focus (identify gaps, deep dive)

## Focus Areas
- Greedy: When to use (optimal substructure, greedy choice)
- Backtracking: Template consistency, pruning strategies
- Pattern recognition: Identify problem type quickly
- Code quality: Clean, readable, well-structured

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Greedy: Not proving optimality, using when DP needed
- Backtracking: Not unchoosing (backtracking) correctly
- Graph: Not handling disconnected components
- Not optimizing after brute force solution

## Month 2 Assessment
- **Target**: Solve all [MUST] problems confidently
- **Patterns**: Recognize and apply 8+ patterns
- **Speed**: Solve medium problems in 20-25 min
- **Next Month**: Advanced DP, Advanced Graphs, System Design deep dive
