# DSA - Week 3

## Topics (Order)
1. Heaps (Min/Max Heap)
2. Priority Queues
3. Trie (Prefix Tree)
4. Advanced Tree Problems

## Patterns to Learn
- Heap operations (insert, extract, heapify)
- K-th largest/smallest element pattern
- Trie for string prefix matching
- Tree serialization/deserialization

## Problems (13 total)

### Heaps
- [MUST] Kth Largest Element in Array (215)
- [MUST] Merge K Sorted Lists (23) - revisit with heap
- [MUST] Top K Frequent Elements (347)
- [GOOD] Find Median from Data Stream (295)
- [GOOD] K Closest Points to Origin (973)
- [GOOD] Task Scheduler (621)

### Trie
- [MUST] Implement Trie (208)
- [MUST] Word Search II (212)
- [GOOD] Add and Search Words (211)
- [GOOD] Longest Word in Dictionary (720)

### Advanced Trees
- [GOOD] Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree (297)
- [GOOD] Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (124)
- [GOOD] Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List (114)

## Focus
- Heap: O(log n) insert/extract, O(n) build
- Priority queue: Use for top K problems
- Trie: O(m) search/insert where m is word length
- Tree problems: Recursive thinking, path problems
