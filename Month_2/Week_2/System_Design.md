# System Design - Week 2

## Core Concepts
- Distributed storage systems (object storage, block storage)
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) architecture
- Database sharding strategies (horizontal partitioning)
- Data consistency patterns (strong, eventual, causal)

## Interview Focus Points
- **Sharding**: Hash-based, range-based, directory-based
- **Replication**: Master-slave, master-master, multi-master
- **Consistency**: CAP theorem trade-offs, quorum reads/writes
- **CDN**: Edge caching, cache invalidation, geographic distribution

## Practice
- Design a distributed file storage (Dropbox-like)
- Design a video streaming service (basic)
- Design a distributed cache system

## Reading
- Consistent hashing
- Database sharding patterns
- CDN architecture and edge computing
- Eventual consistency models
