# Revision - Week 3

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Arrays, Two Pointers (spot check: 2 problems)
- Week 2: Hash maps, Sliding Window (spot check: 2 problems)
- Week 3: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues (all [MUST] problems

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Linked list [MUST] problems (focus on pointer manipulation)
2. **Day 2**: Stack problems (monotonic stack pattern)
3. **Day 3**: Mixed review (1 problem from each week)
4. **Day 4**: Re-solve [GOOD] problems from Week 3
5. **Day 5**: Full mock interview (3 problems, 60 min)

## Focus Areas
- Linked list: Never lose pointer references
- Stack: When to use (matching, next greater, monotonic)
- Edge cases: Empty list, single node, null pointers
- Space-time trade-offs (in-place vs extra space)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Linked list: Modifying while iterating incorrectly
- Stack: Not handling empty stack cases
- Forgetting to update pointers in correct order
- Not considering cycle detection in linked lists
