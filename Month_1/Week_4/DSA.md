# DSA - Week 4

## Topics (Order)
1. Binary Trees (basics)
2. Tree Traversals (DFS, BFS)
3. Binary Search Trees
4. Binary Search (on arrays)

## Patterns to Learn
- DFS (recursive, iterative with stack)
- BFS (queue-based level order)
- BST property (left < root < right)
- Binary search template (left/right boundaries)

## Problems (14 total)

### Binary Trees
- [MUST] Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (104)
- [MUST] Same Tree (100)
- [MUST] Invert Binary Tree (226)
- [MUST] Binary Tree Level Order Traversal (102)
- [GOOD] Symmetric Tree (101)
- [GOOD] Path Sum (112)
- [GOOD] Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder (105)

### Binary Search Trees
- [MUST] Validate Binary Search Tree (98)
- [MUST] Search in a Binary Search Tree (700)
- [GOOD] Insert into a Binary Search Tree (701)
- [GOOD] Lowest Common Ancestor of BST (235)

### Binary Search (Arrays)
- [MUST] Binary Search (704)
- [MUST] Search Insert Position (35)
- [GOOD] Find First and Last Position (34)

## Focus
- Tree recursion base cases (null checks)
- DFS vs BFS: when to use which
- BST validation: range-based approach
- Binary search: avoid off-by-one errors
