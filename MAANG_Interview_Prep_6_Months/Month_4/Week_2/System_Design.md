# System Design - Week 2

## Core Concepts
- Design review and best practices
- Scalability patterns (horizontal vs vertical)
- Reliability patterns (redundancy, failover)
- Consistency patterns (strong, eventual, causal)

## Interview Focus Points
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling strategies, auto-scaling
- **Reliability**: Redundancy, failover, disaster recovery
- **Consistency**: Trade-offs, use cases for each model
- **Design review**: Common mistakes, best practices

## Practice
- Review and improve existing system designs
- Design for 99.99% availability
- Design a globally distributed system

## Reading
- Scalability patterns and anti-patterns
- Reliability engineering principles
- Consistency models and trade-offs
- System design best practices
