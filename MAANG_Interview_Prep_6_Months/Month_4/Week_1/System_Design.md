# System Design - Week 1

## Core Concepts
- Design patterns for large-scale systems
- Database optimization (query optimization, indexing)
- Caching strategies (write-through, write-back, write-around)
- Monitoring and alerting systems

## Interview Focus Points
- **Database optimization**: Query plans, index selection, slow query analysis
- **Caching**: Cache invalidation strategies, cache warming
- **Monitoring**: Metrics, logs, traces, alerting thresholds
- **Performance**: Latency optimization, throughput improvement

## Practice
- Design a monitoring system
- Design a caching layer
- Design a database optimization strategy

## Reading
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies and patterns
- Observability (metrics, logs, traces)
- Performance optimization techniques
