# Revision - Week 1

## What to Revise
- Months 1-3: All core patterns (quick review)
- Bit manipulation: XOR properties, bit masks
- Math: Fast exponentiation, binary search
- Number theory: Prime algorithms, GCD

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Bit manipulation [MUST] problems
2. **Day 2**: Math problems (power, sqrt, division)
3. **Day 3**: Review core patterns from Months 1-3
4. **Day 4**: Mixed practice (bit + math problems)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 problems, 45 min

## Focus Areas
- Bit manipulation: XOR tricks, bit masks
- Math: Binary search for sqrt, fast exponentiation
- Edge cases: Negative numbers, overflow
- Time complexity: Optimize to O(log n) or O(1)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Bit manipulation: Not handling negative numbers correctly
- Math: Integer overflow in calculations
- Not using bit tricks when applicable
- Incorrect time complexity analysis
