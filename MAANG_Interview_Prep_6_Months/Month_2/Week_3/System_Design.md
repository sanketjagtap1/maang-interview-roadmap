# System Design - Week 3

## Core Concepts
- Search systems (inverted index, ranking algorithms)
- Real-time systems (WebSockets, server-sent events)
- Event-driven architecture (event sourcing, CQRS)
- API design (REST, GraphQL, gRPC)

## Interview Focus Points
- **Search**: Indexing, ranking, relevance scoring
- **Real-time**: Polling vs push, WebSocket scaling
- **Event-driven**: Event ordering, idempotency, replay
- **API design**: Versioning, backward compatibility, rate limiting

## Practice
- Design a search engine (basic indexing)
- Design a real-time chat system
- Design an API Gateway

## Reading
- Inverted index and search algorithms
- WebSocket architecture and scaling
- Event-driven patterns (Kafka, event sourcing)
- API design best practices
