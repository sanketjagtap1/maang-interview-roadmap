# Revision - Week 3

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Graphs (quick review: 1 problem)
- Week 2: DP basics (quick review: 1 problem)
- Week 3: Heaps, Trie, Advanced Trees (all [MUST] problems)

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Heap [MUST] problems (Kth Largest, Top K Frequent)
2. **Day 2**: Trie problems (Implement Trie, Word Search II)
3. **Day 3**: Advanced tree problems (serialization, path sum)
4. **Day 4**: Mixed practice (1 heap + 1 trie problem)
5. **Day 5**: Full mock interview (3 problems, 60 min, random topics)

## Focus Areas
- Heap: When to use (top K, median, scheduling)
- Trie: String prefix matching, word search
- Tree: Path problems, serialization patterns
- Data structure selection: Heap vs sorting, Trie vs hash map

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Heap: Not maintaining heap property after operations
- Trie: Not handling word endings correctly
- Tree: Not considering null cases in serialization
- Choosing wrong data structure for problem type
