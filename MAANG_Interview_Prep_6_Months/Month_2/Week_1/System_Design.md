# System Design - Week 1

## Core Concepts
- Database design (normalization, denormalization trade-offs)
- SQL vs NoSQL selection criteria
- Database query optimization (indexing, query plans)
- ACID properties and transaction management

## Interview Focus Points
- **Schema design**: Tables, relationships, indexes
- **Query optimization**: Slow query analysis, index selection
- **Database scaling**: Read replicas, connection pooling
- **Data modeling**: When to denormalize, aggregation strategies

## Practice
- Design a social media feed (basic)
- Design a ticket booking system
- Design a URL shortener (with analytics)

## Reading
- Database indexing strategies
- SQL query optimization techniques
- NoSQL database types (document, key-value, column, graph)
- Database replication and consistency
