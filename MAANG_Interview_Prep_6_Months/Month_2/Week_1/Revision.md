# Revision - Week 1

## What to Revise
- Month_1: Trees (DFS, BFS patterns) - foundation for graphs
- Graph basics: Adjacency list vs matrix representation
- Graph traversal: DFS and BFS implementations
- Cycle detection: Directed vs undirected graphs

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Graph traversal [MUST] problems (Number of Islands, Clone Graph)
2. **Day 2**: DFS/BFS variations (Course Schedule, Rotting Oranges)
3. **Day 3**: Review Month_1 tree problems (connect to graph concepts)
4. **Day 4**: Graph [GOOD] problems (time-boxed: 30 min each)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 graph problems, 45 min

## Focus Areas
- Graph representation: Choose adjacency list for sparse graphs
- Visited tracking: Set vs array (trade-offs)
- DFS recursion: Base cases, backtracking
- BFS: Level-order traversal, shortest path applications

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not marking nodes as visited before processing
- Infinite loops in cycle detection
- Wrong graph representation for problem type
- Forgetting to handle disconnected components
