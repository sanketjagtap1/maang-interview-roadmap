# DSA - Week 1

## Topics (Order)
1. Graphs Basics (adjacency list, matrix)
2. Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
3. Cycle Detection
4. Connected Components

## Patterns to Learn
- Graph DFS (recursive, iterative with stack)
- Graph BFS (queue-based, shortest path)
- Visited set/array for cycle detection
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set) basics

## Problems (13 total)

### Graph Traversal
- [MUST] Number of Islands (200)
- [MUST] Clone Graph (133)
- [MUST] Course Schedule (207)
- [GOOD] Course Schedule II (210)
- [GOOD] Word Ladder (127)

### DFS on Graphs
- [MUST] Max Area of Island (695)
- [GOOD] Surrounded Regions (130)
- [GOOD] Pacific Atlantic Water Flow (417)
- [GOOD] Number of Connected Components (323)

### BFS on Graphs
- [MUST] Rotting Oranges (994)
- [GOOD] Shortest Path in Binary Matrix (1091)

### Cycle Detection
- [GOOD] Graph Valid Tree (261)

## Focus
- Graph representation (adjacency list preferred)
- DFS vs BFS: when to use (pathfinding, shortest path)
- Cycle detection in directed vs undirected graphs
- Time complexity: O(V + E) for adjacency list
