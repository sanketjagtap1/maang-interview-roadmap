# DSA - Week 2

## Topics (Order)
1. Dynamic Programming Basics
2. 1D DP Problems
3. 2D DP Problems
4. DP Optimization (space)

## Patterns to Learn
- Memoization (top-down)
- Tabulation (bottom-up)
- State transition identification
- Space optimization (reduce 2D to 1D)

## Problems (14 total)

### 1D DP
- [MUST] Climbing Stairs (70)
- [MUST] House Robber (198)
- [MUST] Coin Change (322)
- [MUST] Longest Increasing Subsequence (300)
- [GOOD] Decode Ways (91)
- [GOOD] Word Break (139)
- [GOOD] Partition Equal Subset Sum (416)

### 2D DP
- [MUST] Unique Paths (62)
- [MUST] Longest Common Subsequence (1143)
- [MUST] Edit Distance (72)
- [GOOD] Minimum Path Sum (64)
- [GOOD] Coin Change 2 (518)
- [GOOD] Target Sum (494)

### DP on Strings
- [GOOD] Longest Palindromic Subsequence (516)

## Focus
- Identify DP: overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure
- Build recurrence relation first
- Start with brute force, then optimize
- Space optimization: only keep necessary states
