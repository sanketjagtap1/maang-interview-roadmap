# Revision - Week 2

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Graph traversal (quick review: 2 problems)
- DP basics: Memoization vs tabulation
- 1D DP: Climbing Stairs, House Robber, Coin Change
- 2D DP: Unique Paths, LCS, Edit Distance

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: 1D DP [MUST] problems (focus on recurrence relations)
2. **Day 2**: 2D DP [MUST] problems (table building, state transitions)
3. **Day 3**: DP [GOOD] problems (variations and optimizations)
4. **Day 4**: Mixed practice (1 graph + 1 DP problem)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 DP problems, 60 min

## Focus Areas
- DP identification: Overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure
- Recurrence relation: Base cases, state transitions
- Space optimization: Reduce 2D to 1D when possible
- Bottom-up vs top-down: When to use which

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not identifying DP pattern (trying greedy/backtracking first)
- Incorrect base cases in DP table
- Off-by-one errors in DP indices
- Not optimizing space when possible
