# Revision - Week 1

## What to Revise
- Arrays: Two Sum, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- Two Pointers: Valid Palindrome, 3Sum
- Strings: Valid Anagram
- Time complexity of all solutions

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1-2**: Re-solve [MUST] problems without looking at solutions
2. **Day 3**: Review patterns (two pointers, prefix sum)
3. **Day 4**: Re-solve [GOOD] problems with time constraints (30 min each)
4. **Day 5**: Mock interview: Pick 2 random problems, solve in 45 min

## Focus Areas
- Code clarity and variable naming
- Handling edge cases first
- Explaining approach before coding
- Optimizing after brute force solution

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Off-by-one errors in loops
- Not handling empty/null inputs
- Forgetting to sort before two pointers
- Incorrect time complexity analysis
