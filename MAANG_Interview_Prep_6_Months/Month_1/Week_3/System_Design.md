# System Design - Week 3

## Core Concepts
- Microservices architecture (pros/cons, service boundaries)
- API Gateway (routing, authentication, rate limiting)
- Service discovery (consul, etcd, zookeeper)
- Distributed transactions (2PC, saga pattern)

## Interview Focus Points
- **Service decomposition**: When to split services
- **Inter-service communication**: REST, gRPC, message queues
- **Data consistency**: Distributed transactions vs eventual consistency
- **Failure handling**: Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts

## Practice
- Design a microservices architecture (e-commerce basic)
- Design an API Gateway
- Design a distributed lock service

## Reading
- Microservices patterns (Martin Fowler)
- Service mesh basics (Istio, Linkerd)
- Event-driven architecture
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
