# Revision - Week 2

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Arrays, Two Pointers (quick review)
- Hash maps: Two Sum, Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Sliding window: Minimum Window Substring, Longest Repeating Character Replacement
- String manipulation patterns

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Re-solve Week 1 [MUST] problems (time-boxed: 20 min each)
2. **Day 2**: Hash map problems from Week 2
3. **Day 3**: Sliding window problems (focus on template)
4. **Day 4**: Mixed practice (2 problems from each week)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 problems, 45 min total

## Focus Areas
- Hash map vs array trade-offs
- Sliding window boundary conditions
- String manipulation edge cases (empty, single char, special chars)
- Code optimization (reduce space complexity)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Using hash map when array would suffice
- Sliding window: not updating window correctly
- String operations: not considering Unicode/edge cases
- Forgetting to handle empty hash map cases
