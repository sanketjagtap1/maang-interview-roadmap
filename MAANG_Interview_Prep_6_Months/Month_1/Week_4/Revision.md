# Revision - Week 4

## What to Revise
- **Full Month Review**: All topics from Weeks 1-4
- **Priority**: [MUST] problems from all weeks
- **Patterns**: Two pointers, hash maps, sliding window, stacks, trees
- **Time Complexity**: Review O(n), O(n log n), O(log n) patterns

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Week 4 [MUST] problems (trees, BST, binary search)
2. **Day 2**: Review all [MUST] problems from Weeks 1-3 (quick solve, 15 min each)
3. **Day 3**: Pattern-based practice (pick 1 problem per pattern)
4. **Day 4**: Mock interview simulation (3 problems, 60 min, random topics)
5. **Day 5**: Weak area focus (identify gaps, deep dive)

## Focus Areas
- Tree traversals: Recursive vs iterative
- Binary search: Template consistency
- Pattern recognition: Identify problem type quickly
- Code quality: Clean, readable, well-commented

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Tree: Not handling null nodes
- Binary search: Infinite loops (boundary updates)
- Forgetting base cases in recursion
- Not optimizing after brute force

## Month 1 Assessment
- **Target**: Solve all [MUST] problems confidently
- **Patterns**: Recognize and apply 5+ patterns
- **Speed**: Solve medium problems in 25-30 min
- **Next Month**: Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Advanced Trees
