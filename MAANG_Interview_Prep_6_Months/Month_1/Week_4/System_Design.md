# System Design - Week 4

## Core Concepts
- Distributed systems fundamentals (consensus, leader election)
- Database transactions (isolation levels, locking)
- Event sourcing and CQRS
- Monitoring and observability (metrics, logs, traces)

## Interview Focus Points
- **Consistency models**: Strong consistency vs availability
- **Partitioning strategies**: Range, hash, directory-based
- **Monitoring**: What to measure (latency, throughput, error rate)
- **Failure modes**: Network partitions, node failures, data corruption

## Practice
- Design a distributed file system (basic)
- Design a search engine (basic indexing)
- Design a recommendation system (basic)

## Reading
- CAP theorem deep dive
- Distributed consensus (Raft, Paxos basics)
- Database transaction isolation levels
- Observability best practices
