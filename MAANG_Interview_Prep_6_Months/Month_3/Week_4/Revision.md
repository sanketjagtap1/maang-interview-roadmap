# Revision - Week 4

## What to Revise
- **Full Month Review**: Advanced DP, Advanced Graphs, String Algorithms, Advanced Trees
- **Priority**: [MUST] problems from all weeks
- **Patterns**: All patterns from Months 1-3
- **Time Complexity**: Review all complexity classes

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Week 4 [MUST] problems (advanced trees)
2. **Day 2**: Review all [MUST] problems from Weeks 1-3 (quick solve)
3. **Day 3**: Pattern-based practice (1 problem per major pattern)
4. **Day 4**: Mock interview simulation (3 problems, 75 min)
5. **Day 5**: Weak area focus and Month 3 assessment

## Focus Areas
- Advanced trees: Construction, serialization, path problems
- Pattern recognition: Quick identification
- Code quality: Production-ready code
- Optimization: Time and space optimization

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Tree construction: Incorrect index handling
- Not considering all edge cases
- Over-optimizing before brute force
- Not explaining approach clearly

## Month 3 Assessment
- **Target**: Solve hard problems in 40-45 min
- **Patterns**: Recognize and apply 12+ patterns
- **System Design**: Design large-scale systems confidently
- **Next Month**: Mock interviews, company-specific prep, advanced topics
