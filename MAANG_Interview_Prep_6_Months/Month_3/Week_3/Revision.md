# Revision - Week 3

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Advanced DP (quick review)
- Week 2: Graph algorithms (quick review)
- Week 3: Advanced string algorithms, sliding window
- Two pointers patterns

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Advanced sliding window [MUST] problems
2. **Day 2**: String algorithm problems
3. **Day 3**: Review Month_1 string/array basics
4. **Day 4**: Mixed practice (string + array problems)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 string/array problems, 45 min

## Focus Areas
- Sliding window: Multiple constraints, optimization
- String algorithms: Pattern matching, parsing
- Two pointers: Complex conditions
- Edge cases: Empty strings, special characters

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Sliding window: Not updating window correctly
- String: Not handling Unicode/edge cases
- Two pointers: Off-by-one errors
- Not optimizing after brute force
