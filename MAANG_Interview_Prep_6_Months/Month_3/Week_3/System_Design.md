# System Design - Week 3

## Core Concepts
- Search and indexing systems
- Recommendation systems
- Analytics and data processing
- Real-time data processing

## Interview Focus Points
- **Search**: Inverted index, ranking algorithms, relevance
- **Recommendations**: Collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid
- **Analytics**: Data pipeline, ETL, batch vs stream processing
- **Real-time**: Stream processing, windowing, aggregations

## Practice
- Design a search engine (Google-like)
- Design a recommendation system (Netflix-like)
- Design a real-time analytics system

## Reading
- Search engine architecture
- Recommendation algorithms
- Stream processing (Kafka Streams, Flink)
- Data pipeline design
