# Revision - Week 1

## What to Revise
- Month_1: Arrays, Trees, Binary Search (foundation)
- Month_2: Basic DP (1D, 2D) - foundation for advanced DP
- Advanced DP: Multiple states, string DP, tree DP
- State machine patterns

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Advanced DP [MUST] problems (multiple states)
2. **Day 2**: String DP problems (2D table building)
3. **Day 3**: Review Month_2 DP basics (quick refresh)
4. **Day 4**: DP [GOOD] problems (optimizations)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 advanced DP problems, 60 min

## Focus Areas
- DP state identification: What states to track
- String DP: Table initialization, character matching logic
- Tree DP: Bottom-up vs top-down, return values
- Optimization: Space reduction, state reduction

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Not identifying all necessary states
- Incorrect table initialization in string DP
- Tree DP: Not handling null cases correctly
- Not optimizing space when possible
