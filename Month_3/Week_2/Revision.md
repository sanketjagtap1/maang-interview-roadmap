# Revision - Week 2

## What to Revise
- Week 1: Advanced DP (quick review: 1 problem)
- Graph basics: DFS, BFS from Month_2
- Advanced graph algorithms: Shortest path, Union-Find
- MST algorithms

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Day 1**: Shortest path [MUST] problems (Dijkstra pattern)
2. **Day 2**: Union-Find problems (connectivity, cycles)
3. **Day 3**: Graph algorithm [GOOD] problems
4. **Day 4**: Mixed practice (1 DP + 1 graph problem)
5. **Day 5**: Mock interview: 2 graph problems, 60 min

## Focus Areas
- Dijkstra: Priority queue implementation, relaxation
- Union-Find: Path compression, union by rank optimization
- Graph representation: Choose appropriate structure
- Algorithm selection: When to use which algorithm

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Dijkstra: Not handling negative weights (use Bellman-Ford)
- Union-Find: Not optimizing (path compression, union by rank)
- Graph: Not considering disconnected components
- Incorrect time complexity analysis
