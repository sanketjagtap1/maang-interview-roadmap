# System Design - Week 2

## Core Concepts
- Distributed systems (consensus, fault tolerance)
- Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ patterns)
- Event-driven architecture (event sourcing, CQRS)
- Microservices communication patterns

## Interview Focus Points
- **Message queues**: Pub/sub, point-to-point, ordering guarantees
- **Event-driven**: Event ordering, idempotency, replay capability
- **Service communication**: Synchronous vs asynchronous, retry strategies
- **Fault tolerance**: Circuit breakers, bulkheads, timeouts

## Practice
- Design a distributed message queue
- Design an event-driven system
- Design a notification system at scale

## Reading
- Kafka architecture and patterns
- Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- Microservices communication patterns
- Distributed system patterns
