# System Design - Week 4

## Core Concepts
- Storage systems (object storage, block storage)
- Content delivery and CDN
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Security and authentication at scale

## Interview Focus Points
- **Storage**: Object storage vs block storage, durability
- **CDN**: Edge caching, cache invalidation, geographic distribution
- **Rate limiting**: Token bucket, sliding window, distributed rate limiting
- **Security**: OAuth, JWT, API security, encryption at rest/transit

## Practice
- Design a file storage system (Dropbox-like)
- Design a CDN
- Design an authentication/authorization system

## Reading
- Object storage architecture (S3-like)
- CDN architecture and edge computing
- Rate limiting algorithms
- Security best practices for APIs
