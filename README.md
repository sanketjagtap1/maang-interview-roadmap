## 🛠️ Building the UI

If you update any markdown files, rebuild the HTML to see changes:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system

### Build Steps

1. **Navigate to the repository:**
   ```bash
   cd Interview
   ```

2. **Run the build script:**
   ```bash
   node build.js
   ```

3. **What the build script does:**
   - Reads all markdown files from `Month_1` through `Month_6`
   - Embeds them in `index.html` as JavaScript data
   - Updates the content viewer to use embedded data
   - Removes any duplicate content

4. **Open the updated HTML:**
   - Open `index.html` in your browser
   - Hard refresh (`Ctrl + Shift + R`) to see changes

### Build Script Details

The `build.js` script:
- Scans all month/week/category directories
- Reads each markdown file
- Properly escapes content for JavaScript
- Embeds everything in a single HTML file
- Works completely offline after building
