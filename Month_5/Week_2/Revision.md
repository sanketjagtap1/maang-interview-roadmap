# Revision - Week 2

## What to Revise
- **Pattern Mastery**: Quick pattern recognition
- **Optimization**: Time/space optimization techniques
- **Code Quality**: Clean code principles
- **Weak Areas**: Focus on gaps

## Re-solve Strategy
1. **Daily**: 2-3 problems with optimization focus
2. **Mock Interviews**: Continue regular mocks
3. **Code Review**: Self-review for quality
4. **Optimization**: Always optimize solutions
5. **Review**: Weekly performance review

## Focus Areas
- Optimization: Reduce time/space complexity
- Code quality: Clean, readable, maintainable
